/**
 * @brief A function to move the controlled motor to the desired position. The run
 * 		  function in the P_Control class calculates the PWM signal that will be
 *        sent to the motor by taking into account the setpoint of the motor, and
 *        the current position of the motor. These values are subtracted to find the
 *        error which is then multiplied by Kp. If this value exceeds -100 or 100, the
 *        value is saturated to either -100 or 100. Then the set_duty_cycle function
 *        imported from the motor_driver class is run. The calculated PWM signal is
 *        returned at the end of the function.
