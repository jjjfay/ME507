/*To implement your driver you will need to create a new datatype using a C struct and the typedef keyword. The structure should have fields representing the information pertinent to a specific motor driver channel - perhaps with information like:
The handle to the HAL timer object used for PWM generation.
The pins and ports associated with the pins used by the driver.
What channels on the timer are associated with the PWM pins.
Any other information needed inside the three functions mentioned above.*/
